Thanks for giving me this opurtunity to do this Porject.. I came to learn about react hooks and type script, which i haven't used before.  

Used React Hooks, Used ReCharts for chart components. Used React DOM and redux. Used UI core, UI icons, UI labs. Used react script, react toastify. Used typecript for this code.
